                    What do we need?
                    In order to have a fully functioning system we need to follow the student’s progress and users’ statistics that will include the student registration and login, monitoring the student assessment and so on. We need this access both from mobile and browser apps
                    See how good they progressed, what were their strong/weak parts and so on, it will be available both from the mobile application itself and from browser
                    Marketing website this will be the face of hiMath Gaming towards clients, students, and in general whoever will come around our products.
